                                    <h3>ESPORTS AMATEUR COMPETITORS LEAGUE HISTORY </h3>

                                    <p> Why EACL was created.</p>

                                    <p>The ESports Amateur Competitors League was born out of a passion for two things- social entrepreneurship and gaming. Thespring board for everything you see here is the belief that we can do MORE than the other gaming platforms and create positive impacts for multiple communities at once.</p>

                                    <p>Our unique business model addresses issues that are very real for American families, providing:</p>

                                    <p>
                                        Income opportunities for gamers
                                        <ul style="padding-left:50px">
                                            <li>No-cost fund raising for nonprofits</li>
                                            <li>College scholarships</li>
                                            <li>Life-changing prizes like an Audi A5</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </p>

                                    <img src="images/head.png" style="width:100%;" />

                                    <p>The current ZTK Token model provides users the ability to liquidate their ZTKTokens through the ERC20 ZSECOIN DigitalCurrency. The ERC20ZTK Token will give gamers an alternative method of redeeming their winnings from the EACL Platform. An ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain offers additional functionality that is seldom found on a centralized token ecosystem</p>


                                    <p>EACL sees alot of potential in converting the ZTK Token into an Ethereum-based utility token. A year ago we created the ZTK Token toallow global participants to watchand participate in all of the topesports matches in the world. By combining the amazing winnings on the EACL Platform with the ZTKToken creates not only the highest paid gaming platforms but also creates long term financial opportunities with ZSECOIN.</p>

                                    <p>While EACL has been successful in engaging and retaining customers, upgrading the redemption capabilities with this Ethereum-based utility token will dramatically increase usage and utility. We intent for the ZTK Token to become a standard token for the esports and gaming industry and backed by ZSECOIN</p>

                                    <h3>IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS</h3>


                                    <p>The launchof new features on theEACL Platform utilizing ZTK Token may be delayed for reasons beyond company control and may ultimately prove unsuccessful. EACL may discontinue features if theyare not profitable, meet changing regulationsor licensing requirements, or for other undiscovered reasons.</p>

                                    <p>The value ofthe ZTK Token will depend on its acceptance as ameans of currency utilization and forobtainingservices andproducts onthe EACL Platform. The value may be affected by market conditions and other factors,including changes in regulations of esports gamingand token utilization. Such changes may adverselyeffect onthe utility and value of the tokens.</p>

                                    <p>Unless other esports platforms adopt the use of ZTK Tokens, ZTK Tokens will not have any utility during any period in which circumstances require EACL to suspend platform operations.. No other platforms have indicated that they intend to adopt ZTK Tokens at this time.</p>

                                    <p>The value ofZTK Tokens will be affected by the demand for the token relative to its supply. ZTK Tokens intends to augment the supply by allowing participants to earn ZTK Tokens through activity on the Platform and by selling or trading ZTK Tokens.</p>

                                    <p>The ability to convert ZTK Tokens into ZSE COIN or other cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies will depend on thed evelopment of a trading market for the token and value of ZSECOIN going forward</p>
